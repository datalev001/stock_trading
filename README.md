From Skepticism to Strategy: Unraveling the Complex Web of Market Trends, Trading Tactics, and Data Science Insights
I've always heard that being good with numbers and fancy math tricks could be the key to making a lot of money in the stock market. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about it, and here's why.

Even though I'm really into data science, have a PhD in statistics, have worked on a bunch of predictions for businesses, and even won some early Kaggle contests, I thought I knew everything about the stock market. With all my knowledge about how the economy and stocks work, I was sure I'd do well.

But when I actually tried out my ideas, things didn't work out like I expected. It was quite a wake-up call.

#1: Understanding Your Profits and Losses in Stock Trading 
“Predicting stock is like trying to guess what others are thinking”

When we see stock prices jumping up and down, we can't help but think about making some cash. It's like, when you see a graph where the prices shoot up, you feel like you can grab a piece of the action and make some money off those ups and downs. We tend to believe that what happened before will happen again, so we look for patterns from the past thinking we can guess what's next. It's kind of like checking the weather before you plan a day out; if you know it's going to rain, you'll bring an umbrella, right? 

Sure, predicting stock prices isn't the same as checking the weather, but the idea is similar: one's about planning your day, and the other's about trying to make some money from the stock market. The trick is to spot the trends in past data and use those insights to guess what's around the corner, then act on those predictions to hopefully make some money.

But there's one big thing we often miss. Predicting stock prices and predicting the weather are totally different games. Predicting the weather is a lot simpler. Your guess about the weather doesn't change what the weather will actually do. The weather does its own thing, whether you guess it right or not. But with stocks, it's way more complex. The stock market is full of people trying to make quick money, and everyone's trying to predict what's going to happen next. The problem is, all these guesses and the trading moves they lead to can mess up any predictions, even if you've got a really smart algorithm. And by smart, I mean something that's proven itself by looking back at past data. The issue is straightforward: your algorithm can't possibly know how everyone else is going to predict and act on those predictions.
